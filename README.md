# Tetris-Clone-Game

This project is a 2D Tetris game built in Unity using C#.  
The GUI consists of three scenes: the game board interface, a main menu, and game over screen.  
  
Features of this Tetris clone include   
* Previewing the next three tetrominos.
* Sound: Both sound effects for tetromino movement and clearing a line, as well as background music.
* Levels: The user may choose the level on the main menu, the higher the level, the faster the tetrominos fall, the more difficult it is. The game also increases in difficulty as the user plays.
